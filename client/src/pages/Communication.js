          There is one all-time greatest moment in the history of sports, and it
          happened in the 1932 World Series. The story goes that in the bottom
          of the ninth inning with two outs, a full count and the tying run on
          base, Babe Ruth raised his arm and pointed to the center field
          bleachers. No one believed it, because nobody had ever done it before.
          But The Babe was calling his shot. On the next pitch, the Great
          Bambino hit a towering home run. And even although he'd been a hero
          before that, that's pretty much how he became a legend. Thirty years
          later, a kid named Benjamin Franklin Rodriguez... became a
          neighborhood legend. It was in the greatest summer of my life... when
          he taught me to play baseball, and he became my best friend. And he
          got me out of the biggest pickle I'd ever be in. ['50s Rock] It's
          finger poppin' Poppin' time I feel so good And that's a real good sign
          [ Kids Shouting ] Here comes Mary Here comes Sue Here comes Johnny and
          Bobby too It's finger pop Poppin' time I feel so good - And that's a
          real good sign - Go! Go! Go! [ Shouting Continues ] I feel so good And
          that's a real good sign [ Snapping Fingers ] Come over at : . All
          right. See you later. I moved to the neighborhood two weeks before
          school let out. It was the same summer that Dodger Maury Wills would
          break the stolen bases record. It was the same summer that Dodger
          Maury Wills would break the stolen bases record. So with something
          that incredible going on, it should've started off with loads of great
          things happening for me, but it didn't. I was from another state, and
          I didn't have a single friend in a thousand miles. It was a lousy way
          to end up the fifth grade, 'cause I had zip time to make friends
          before summer. And that's about where it all started. My real dad died
          when I was just a little kid. My mom had married Bill about a year
          before we moved to the Valley. At the time, he and I were still
          getting used to each other. - [ Knocking ] - Yeah. - Um, Dad? - Mm-hm
          m? I -I mean Bill. - Remember you-- you promised you'd teach me to
          play catch? - Mm-hmm. Um, w-well, could you teach me? Yeah. Sure.
          Okay. - Okay? - Thanks. Sorry. [Man Narrating] I'd followed them to
          the sandlot once after school. - I'd never seen any place like it. - [
          Boys Shouting ] It was like their own little baseball kingdom or
          something. It was the greatest place I'd ever seen anyway. - Bertram.
          - But they were good, - real good. - Come on, Bertram! And all I had
          was a plastic toy mitt that my grandmother gave me... for my birthday
          when I was six. But when I finally got up enough guts to go out there
          and try and make friends, I found out that they never kept score, they
          never chose sides, they never even really stopped playing the game. It
          just went on forever. Every day they picked up where they left off the
          day before. - It was like an endless dream game. - Come on! Come on!
          There was only eight of them, so they didn't have a whole team. So
          even though I didn't know how to play, I figured I could be the ninth
          man... and maybe just stand in the outfield somewhere and take up
          space. - Squints! - Of course, if I'd have known what was gonna happen
          when I got there, - I got it! - I probably never would've gone. - Nice
          catch. - Yeah. - Come on! - [ Rustling ] [ Dog Barking ] [ Clattering,
          Banging ] [ Growling ] Come on, Benny, hit a homer! - Come on! - Hey,
          batter, batter, batter! - Whoa! - Watch out! [ Boys Shouting ] - [
          Screams ] - [ All Laughing ] Okay, I'll get it! Get it. Don't be a
          goofus. Don't be a goofus! Don't be a goofus! [Rumbling Sound, Dog
          Growling] - Throw the ball back! Come on! - Yeah, hurry up! [Barking]
          We are waiting! Come on! Throw it! [Boys Shouting] [ Shouting
          Continues ] - Come on, toss me the ball! - Come on! Come on! [ Boys
          Laughing ] - Oh, my God! - [ Laughing Continues ] My life's over. Did
          you see that hand? [Boys Chattering, Laughing] [Man Narrating] If it
          wasn't for Benny, I never would've made a single friend that summer,
          'cause all the rest of those guys thought I was a lost cause. - Even
          before we became friends, - [ Mechanical Whirring ] Benny and me were
          connected, connected for the one moment later that summer... when I'd
          get us all into the biggest pickle... any of us had ever seen. [
          Knocking ] Night, hon. [ Grunts ] Oh, I'm sorry, Mom. It was an
          accident. Scotty, have you made any friends yet? - No. - Why not,
          honey? 'Cause I'm still new. I don't want you sitting around in here
          all summer fiddling with this stuff... like you did last summer and
          the one before. I know you're smart, and I'm proud of you. I want you
          to get out into the fresh air and make some friends. Run around,
          scrape your knees, get dirty. Climb trees, hop fences. Get into
          trouble, for crying out loud. Not too much, but some. You have my
          permission. How many mothers do you know who say something like that
          to their sons? [ Chuckles ] Well, none mothers, I guess. Honey, I want
          you to make some friends this summer. Lots of them. Yeah, I know. But
          I'm not good at anything, Mom. Face it, I'm just an egghead. Honey,
          you'll always be just an egghead with an attitude like that. [TV:
          Indistinct] [ Whispering ] Well? Well? - He's too busy, Mom. - Oh, no,
          honey, he's not. He has some time. You go on back out there and ask
          him. [TV Continues ] - Uh, Bill, uh-- - Yeah? I mean, Dad, uh, can
          we-- I mean, could you, like you said, teach me to play catch?
